    "    1.1 **Application**\n",
    "    \n",
    "      Decision trees have been used to diagnose [ovarian cancer in women](http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC521504/). Data from the spectral profiles of serum proteins from patients who have either ovarian cancer, benign pelvic diseases, and who were otherwise healthy, were used in the analysis. A decision tree was then built using five protein peaks as features, which then resulted in an accuracy of better than $\\sim$ 80%.\n",
    "      \n",
    "    1.2 **Strengths**\n",
    "    \n",
    "      I think the most prominent advantage of a decision tree classifier is that is quite simple to understand and read, in the sense that one is quite familiar with making trees in the decisions one makes in everyday life, not requiring any technical knowledge in machine learning. It needs little data preparation (e.g. regularization, and normalization), as one simply splits the parameter space depending on the questions being asked. It also performs well with large datasets, and it's predictive power can be validated using statistical tests. This classifier can also handle both numeric and categorical data.\n",
    "      \n",
    "    1.3 **Weaknesses**\n",
    "    \n",
    "      As the number of features increase, decision trees are prone to become too large, complicated trees that do not generalize the data very well [over-fitting]. These tend to be sensitive to small perturtabtions in the data. Slightly changing the splits can easily result into an entirely different tree, and thus different prediction, potentially. Decision trees also would not perfom well in relatively small training sets, and would create biased trees when one class dominates over the other/others.\n",
    "      \n",
    "    1.4  **Why**\n",
    "    \n",
    "      In terms of the attributes of the features, most of the features are either categorical or of the yes-no (binary) type. Furthermore, most these features take on a small number of possible values (except for \"absences\" feature, having 34 possible values). The categorical nature of most of the features bears resemblance to the classification problem for the Titanic, where a decision tree was used to make classifications.  \n",
    "      \n",
    "      It seems reasonable that we can at least try to set up a decision tree as we ask various questions about our sample and identify which features are good predictors of student success. For these reasons, my gut tells me that a decison tree might be worthwhile to experiment with.\n",
    "      \n",
    "      But, unlike the Titanic dataset, this one is quite small (less than half of the Titanic set), and has a much larger set of features. Splitting into training and validation sets make it even smaller. The two datasets have roughly a similar imbalace between classes (i.e. $\\sim$ 30% survival rate vs $\\sim$32% failure rate), as well. Hence, given these problematic features on the dataset, the decision tree might not perform as well as I would hope. But we'll see. These concerns also lead me to try an ensemble classifier below.     \n",

    "    \n",
    "    Since Adaboost is used in conjuction with other classifiers, such as decision trees to improve performance, many of its applications involve boosting on decision trees. One prominent example is the Viola-Jones face detector, which which [\"selects a small number of critical visual features from a larger set and yields extremely efficient classifiers\"](http://www.cs.utexas.edu/~grauman/courses/spring2007/395T/papers/viola_cvpr2001.pdf).\n",
